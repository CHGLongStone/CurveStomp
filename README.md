# CurveStomp
a project for self-reporting COVID 19 symptoms and resource requirements for those who are isolated or quarantined 

This project will lay out an initial specification including a transport envelope for API access for aggregate reporting 
It may be more effective for people to manage local instances but we need central reporting 


The initial implementation will be LAMP based, converting this to node.js would be helpful

* personal information will not be required, following will be useful
 * postal code
 * email
 
* users will be provided with a GUID for access 
* reporting should be done every day or 2 until the outbrake has subsided

## we need to track:

 * symtoms
  * severity
  
 * resources 
  * to spare
  * need
  * desperate need

# Data model and workflow and any other technical information will be laid out in Wiki
